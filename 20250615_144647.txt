Binary numbers are a fundamental part of computer science, using only two
digits-0 and 1-to represent data. These digits, called bits, form the basis
of all digital information processing. Hexadecimal systems extend binary by
adding four more symbols (A-F), making it easier to represent large binary
values succinctly. For example, hexadecimal ranges from 0-F, while decimal
extends only to 9. Bytes, which are groups of eight bits, allow computers to
process and store data efficiently in a structured manner. Understanding these
systems is crucial for programming and digital system design.
