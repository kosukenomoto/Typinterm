Here is an English passage of exactly 100 words for typing practice on a
technical topic related to **C++**: --- C++ is a powerful programming language
known for its efficiency and flexibility in system-level applications. It
extends C with additional features such as classes, functions, operator
overloading, and templates. The syntax includes keywords like `class`,
`function`, `while`, `if`, `for`, and operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`.
Memory management is handled using pointers and references, while dynamic data
structures are often managed through containers like vectors and strings from
the Standard Template Library (STL). Bitwise operations use symbols such as `~`
for NOT and `\` for escape sequences. Understanding C++ requires practice with a
wide range of punctuation marks, including parentheses `()`, square brackets
`[]`, braces `{}`, colons `:`, semicolons `;`, commas `,`, periods `.`, question
marks `?`, exclamation points `!`, and periods `.` in class definitions.
Debugging often involves checking for syntax errors, such as mismatched braces
or invalid function arguments, while object-oriented programming concepts like
inheritance and polymorphism are central to C++'s design. --- This passage
includes various printable ASCII characters and adheres to the 100-word
requirement.
