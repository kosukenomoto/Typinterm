Here's an English passage for typing practice on C++: "C++ is a powerful
programming language known for its efficiency and flexibility. It combines
object-oriented and procedural programming paradigms, making it ideal for
system-level applications. With features like templates, operator overloading,
and exception handling, C++ provides developers with robust tools to create
high-performance software. For instance, using `std::string` allows efficient
string manipulation, while `std::vector` offers dynamic array capabilities.
Operators such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` are fundamental in performing
arithmetic operations on various data types. Control structures like `if`,
`for`, and `while` enable conditional and loop-based execution of code. By
mastering C++, developers can build applications ranging from simple scripts to
complex embedded systems, leveraging its extensive library support." This
passage is approximately 100 words long, uses only printable ASCII characters,
and includes a variety of punctuation marks as required.
