Binary numbers are fundamental to computer science because they form the basis
of how computers represent and process data. Each binary digit, or bit, can be
either a 0 or a 1, corresponding to the off or on state of an electronic
circuit. By using combinations of bits, computers can represent complex
information such as text, images, and programs. Hexadecimal numbers, which use
base 16, are often used in computing because they provide a more compact
representation of binary data. For example, one byte of information can be
represented with two hexadecimal digits instead of eight binary digits. This
makes it easier for humans to read and write, while computers still process
everything in binary form. Understanding these number systems is essential for
anyone working with low-level programming or digital electronics.
