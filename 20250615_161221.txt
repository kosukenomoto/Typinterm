Hereâ€™s an English passage of exactly 100 words for typing practice on a
technical topic (about C++) related to computer science: "C++ is a powerful
programming language that combines features from both C and object-oriented
programming. A typical program in C++ starts with including necessary headers,
such as <iostream> and <string>, followed by using namespace std;. When
declaring variables, you must specify their types explicitly. For example, int x
= 5; declares an integer variable named 'x' initialized to 5. Functions can be
defined with return types, like bool isPrime(int n) { ... }, which returns true
if 'n' is prime. Classes are fundamental in C++, allowing encapsulation and
abstraction. A simple class definition might look like: class MyClass { public:
int count; void method() { count++; } }; Here's a loop that adds two numbers
using while: int sum = 0; for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { sum += i; } cout <<
"Sum: " << sum << endl; // Outputs the result. Error handling is crucial in C++
to manage unexpected situations. Try-catch blocks ensure programs don't crash
abruptly, like catching exceptions from functions such as sqrt(-5), which would
otherwise return NaN. Modular arithmetic and operator overloading are also
common operations in C++. This brief overview demonstrates just a fraction of
what C++ can achieve." This passage includes letters A-Z and a-z, digits 0-9,
and various punctuation and symbols, all within the 100-word limit.
